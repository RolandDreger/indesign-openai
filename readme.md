## Use Cases
Here are some use cases: [Translation, Text Shortening, Headline Creation](https://vimeo.com/836122207), [Images](https://vimeo.com/835233091), [Index](https://vimeo.com/834805501) (For demonstration purposes only, not included in the plugin.), [Table editing](https://vimeo.com/869998618) or [image description](https://vimeo.com/895310245). And GREP expressions are also a good use case.

You have others, please let me know ...

## Remark
I think many things about *»Artificial Intelligence«* are currently rightly criticized, such as high energy consumption, unclear copyright, discrimination by algorithms, dubious origin of the training data and also poor working conditions and payment of those who classified them. 

Nevertheless, AI has come to stay and offers many interesting new possibilities. Ultimately, everyone has to decide for themselves whether to use it or not.
